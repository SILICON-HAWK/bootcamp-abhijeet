    <!-- Exercise 1: Font -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-1 Font</h2>
        <p>The font exercise was good, but didn't follow the CSS Zen Garden Template guidelines.</p>
        <p>The information provided could be structured better.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 2: Color -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-2 Color</h2>
        <p>The color exercise was good, with nice margins, padding, and font spacing.</p>
        <p>However, Level 2 didn't work as intended, and the button didn't function.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 3: Icons -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-3 Icons</h2>
        <p>The icon exercise was well-done, with good color choices and icon implementation.</p>
        <p>Adding a small context for the icons would be beneficial.</p> 
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 4: Images -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-4 Images</h2>
        <p>The image exercise was good, but could benefit from more information about the changes made.</p>
        <p>Adding image properties would also be helpful.</p>
        
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 5: Sample Website -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-5 Sample Website</h2>
        <p>The article layout was good, with nice visual styling.</p>
        <p>Adding more content, a date, and context about the image would be beneficial.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 6: Design in Practice -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-6 Design in Practice</h2>
        <p>Could not find the link for the redesign page</p>
    </section>
