    <!-- Exercise 1: Font -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-1 Font</h2>
        <p>The font exercise was good, providing all necessary information and showing the reasoning and effect of certain decisions.</p>
        <p>The background color was easy on the eyes</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 2: Color -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-2 Color</h2>
        <p>The color exercise was really cool, content was a bit lacking in my opinion to see the full extent of the color themes but still really nice.</p>
        <p>The color choices were excellent, and the dark and light themes complemented each other well.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 3: Icons -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-3 Icons</h2>
        <p>The icon exercise was well-done, with good color choices and a well-implemented design.</p>
        <p>Providing clearer labels and using better icons and proper aligining and sizing of icons in some places would be beneficial.</p>
        
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 4: Images -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-4 Images</h2>
        <p>The image exercise was good, with nice designs and layouts.</p>
        <p>Adding more context and information about image properties would be helpful.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 5: Sample Website -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-5 Sample Website</h2>
        <p>The layout exercise was well done, with a well-designed landing page that was consistent in styling.</p>
        <p>usage of cards was really well done</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 6: Design in Practice -->
    <section>
        <p>The redesign efforts were outstanding, with excellent annotations and a clear flow of information.</p>
        <p>The redesigns for the IRCTC website and Press release page were well-done, but could benefit from adding a date.</p>
