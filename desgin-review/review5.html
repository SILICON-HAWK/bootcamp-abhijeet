    <h1>Design Review</h1>
    <a href="https://yashrajsingh.netlify.app/">Yashraj 's Webpage that will be the focus of this review</a>
    <!-- Exercise 1: Font -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-1 Font</h2>
        <p>Beautifully designed website each page leads up to and builds on the previous tasks showing clear progression of the design after each page we are giving the option to continue to change and apply more style</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>No notes mentioned</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 2: Color -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-2 Color</h2>
        <p>This page also builds up on the fonts page by applying colors to the elements and show proper spacing and margins and cards to make the page intuitive to look at</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>No notes mentioned</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 3: Icons -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-3 Icons</h2>
        <p>Good demonstration of Icon usage and how to implement them, various functionality is also added dynamically via I am assuming javascript so the page feels good to navigate and move around it</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>No notes mentioned </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 4: Images -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-4 Images</h2>
        <p>just like all the previous pages this one has a story to it in a way, where each new pages build up on the previous experiences and creates a good looking design by the end of this task, using various CSS techniques</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>No mention of any note</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 5: Sample Website -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-5 Sample Website</h2>
        <p>The sample webpage being made here is Medium to properly demonstrate the importance of layout and spacing. Generally speaking as this is a clone website the impression remains the same as visiting medium website</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 6: Design in Practice -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-6 Design in Practice</h2>
        <h3>Website Design Review</h3>
        <p>The design of the comparision website is good as it differentiates b/w the various websites using cards for each side of the comparision, the content inside the cards also have a clear hierarchy </p>
        <h3>Redesign</h3>
        <p>The Redesign website is IRCTC website and IIT M faculty details page, both of which looks great as there is no clutter and the content is clear to the user.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Final verdict is 9/10</h1>
        <p>All the web pages are beautify but during the navigation of I have discovered that there is a issue where if the user is in the middle of multiple transition page say, sol1-1 till sol2-3 there is no way for the user to go to the main page/index and constantly clicking back button can be a but annoying you can navigate via modifying the URL but not every user can be assumed to be tech savy enough to understand that also without clear knowledge of the path its not possible, Outside of this the website is very good looking</p>
