    <a href="https://inquisitive-zuccutto-e14a75.netlify.app/">Anik's Webpage that will be the focus of this review</a>
    <!-- Exercise 1: Font -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-1 Font</h2>

        <p>The design layout of all the font pages is fairly standard, if anything is to be improved that would be side margins and padding also line height etc but otherwise fairly good</p>

        <p>Fairly standard note for the task, no chatgpt link seems like the design was self made</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 2: Color -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-2 Color</h2>
        <p>The Navigation is a bit difficult for this section of the page because to see the difference of colors we have to move b/w the various pages and the color elements are not big enough for us to clearly see the difference of using one theme over the other</p>
        <p>For the Color swatch part the website shows a massive number of colors to the users overwhelming them with too much at once and its not clear which color is being used when</p>
        <p>standard notes, but no link for LLM logs, but it is mentioned that LLM is being used</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 3: Icons -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-3 Icons</h2>
        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>Page link broken ? it seems</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>grid of Icons, usage of transform to make icon big on hover, keep the page interactive</p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>Standard looking nav bar and download and upload button to accompany them</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>Used LLM and Youtube to embed the SVG icons according to notes</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 4: Images -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-4 Images</h2>
        <p>Basic implementation of image and picture elements with various styles like the full bleed header and lazy loading for the last page, The website could use a bit of text content to accompany the images otherwise fairly good</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>Notes mention the thought process and the reasoning and implementation details regarding the various task, no mention of LLMs or similar tools</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 5: Sample Website -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-5 Sample Website</h2>
        <p>This sample website is a medium clone so the overall layout is very good, the responsiveness is a bit off the track but outside of that the web page looks good with proper element, hierarchy, fonts and icons to accompany all of them</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 6: Design in Practice -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-6 Design in Practice</h2>
        <h3>Website Design Review</h3>
        <p>The various Website design review pages are accompanied with little to no css design so there is nothing much to add here</p>
        <h3>Redesign</h3>
        <p>The redesign for the IRCTC and Factulty page is pretty good as the elements are clear, the Navigation of the page is easy to understand, there is not too much clutter to the pages.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h1>Final verdict is 6/10 design</h1>
        <h3>The design for the various webpages are not bad but all of them are very standard and some pages like the color swatch is a bit cluttered</h3>
