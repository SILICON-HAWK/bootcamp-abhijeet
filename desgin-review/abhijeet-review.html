    <section>
        <h2>EX-1 Font</h2>
        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>this section has one issue that is that the page does not have consistency as more than 1 font is being used here making it look out of place</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>The 2nd page it a much better than the first one as the page is consistent and has proper page hierarchy with main heading having more weight and larger font</p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>This page builds up on the previous ones as this has proper spacing and consistency, along with proper font weights and line height making the text look easy on the eyes. </p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>Since this was a rather simple page there is not a lot of information in the notes page but it does have the link to chatgpt chat</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 2: Color -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-2 Color</h2>
        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>This page is the one where we have to show our understanding of coloring of pages with monochromatic, complementary and thee color scheme, since making 3 pages for this was kind of redundant and boring I had decided to use javascript to switch the colors of the page element dynamically to show visually what the difference b/w each type of theme is. There are card on the page which can be clicked to change colors</p>
        <p>There is one issue with this page yet which is that the elements do not respond dynamically for different screen sizes so sometimes the card elements are all over the page making it hard to use</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>Again to Demonstrate the visual difference b/w light and dark theme I have decided to use javascript to dynamically change the page colors</p>
        <p>There are 3 sections for this page that are the, Header part, the color swatches part (this section shows the various colors being used in the page), and lastly the image with text overlay part.</p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>The 3rd level for this task was mostly revolving around gradients so the header part has a color gradient that is applied linearly, and the buttons were supposed to be radially gradient so they have those as well.</p>
        <p>If there is anything to be complained about it would be that to showcase various gradients some colors do not properly blend together so it looks out of place for ex the 2nd button.</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>There are 2 chatgpt links leading to the chat logs <a href="../design/ex-2/notes.html"> notes </a> </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 3: Icons -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-3 Icons</h2>
        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>Simple icon demonstration with on:hover effect</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>There is a grid used to Demonstrate how icon libraries and SVG icons works, if anything the contrast b/w the choice of color is bad as they do not seem to blend and stick out like a sore thumb</p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>This page is again a simple usage of icons and there are 2 buttons for download and upload using the up and down arrow icons along with a simple navbar. The color scheme used here is not bad its easy on the eyes and pleasant to look at, if something has to be improved usage of border radius would make the page look better</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>There is link leading to a chatgpt log</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 4: Images -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-4 Images</h2>
        <h3>Solution 1</h3>
        <p>This is the first demonstration for images with various height and width format, there is no content here so the page looks a bit weird if strictly speaking about the page layout, as there is no layout here</p>
        <h3>Solution 2</h3>
        <p>This is the 2nd task with a full bleed header and an image adjusted to the size and proper compression, there is also a slight dark tint applied to the background to make it look a bit dark</p>
        <p>This page looks very good as there is proper content complementing the design of the header and the image, this page emulates an article so the header and image looks appropriate.</p>
        <h3>Solution 3</h3>
        <p>This is a very simple page with an image demonstrating lazy loading of the image </p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>There is chatgpt link and reasoning behind the decision made for the changes made to the pages if any</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 5: Sample Website -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-5 Sample Website</h2>
        <p>The sample website being used here Is a news article, The hierarchy of the page is properly defined, with the usage of cards to differentiate b/w different article the page follows the minimalist design.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 6: Design in Practice -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-6 Design in Practice</h2>
        <h3>Website Design Review</h3>
        <p>The website design for comparing the different types of web designs, here the comparison is between the press release of the indian gov and the US gov, The website design color is not that great and looks a bit off, but the hierarchy and card style along with proper margins and padding is good.</p>
        <h3>Redesign</h3>
        <p>The redesign for the indian press release website is much better than the original, as there is proper cards to differentiate b/w different cards, along with proper spacing and margins making it easier to read and navigate</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Final verdict is 7/10 design</h1>
        <h3> <p>outside of some pages purely for the sake of demonstration of certain properties and elements which leads to the page being empty excluding that the design is not that bad but it could be made better.</p> Also the support for different screen sizes is important</h3>
