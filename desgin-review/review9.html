    <h1>Design Review</h1>
    <a href="https://inexpensive-north.surge.sh/">Shilpa's Webpage that will be the focus of this review</a>
    <!-- Exercise 1: Font -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-1 Font</h2>
        <p>The font choices were good, especially in Level 1 where the CSS Zen Garden template was used.</p>
        <p>Consistency with the template would be really appreciated because we can clearly see the progression of changes</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 2: Color -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-2 Color</h2>
        <p>The color palette was consistent and well-chosen, making the design look great.</p>
        <p>The overall design of the page was good and easy to understand</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 3: Icons -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-3 Icons</h2>
        <p>The icons could benefit from more context and explanation.</p>
        <p>Outside of that the usage of Icons here shows they understand how to use icons</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 4: Images -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-4 Images</h2>
        <p>Adding more context and information about the images would be helpful.</p>
        <p>Right now, the images are just presented without much explanation or context.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 5: Sample Website -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-5 Sample Website</h2>
        <p>The article website looks very good as it minimalist with no clutter and distracting elements</p>
        <p>The 2nd website also looks very good, the usage of cards is very nice touch giving the user a small thumbnail and a small into to the content</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 6: Design in Practice -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-6 Design in Practice</h2>
        <p>The redesign efforts were good on the IRISET/IRCTC website,  but over all strictly speaking the page still looks quite cluttered and little hint to where the user is supposed to go or what to do</p>
        <p>The various reasoning behind the bad designs are very valid though </p>
