    <h1>Design Review</h1>
    <a href="http://racial-quiver.surge.sh/">Zoya's Webpage that will be the focus of this review</a>
    <!-- Exercise 1: Font -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-1 Font</h2>
        <p>The Design of the website is good and the choice of Fonts are also good but The lack of usage of CSS zen template kinda takes away from the experience of seeing font make a change in the design of a website</p>
        <p>Other than that the overall design of the page is nice, could use a better set of colors though</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 2: Color -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-2 Color</h2>
        <p>The color palette was excellent, with consistent styling throughout.</p>
        <p>The dark mode color choice was particularly well-done.</p>
        <p>The HSL and gradients were also well-executed.</p>        
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 3: Icons -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-3 Icons</h2>
        <p>The icons were subtle and fit well with the content and styling.</p>
        <p>Until and unless I am misunderstanding there are no SVG is level 2 its just icon packs</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 4: Images -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-4 Images</h2>
        <p>The image information was good, but could benefit from more details about image properties.</p>
        <p>The styling and layout were consistent throughout.</p>
        <p>The Level 3 image exercise was simple and effective.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 5: Sample Website -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-5 Sample Website</h2>
        <p>The article layout was good, with nice visual styling.</p>
        <p>Adding more content to the article would be beneficial in seeing how it looks with long form content.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Exercise 6: Design in Practice -->
    <section>
        <h2>EX-6 Redesign </h2>
        <p>The redesign efforts were excellent, with good image annotations and a modern interface.</p>
        <p>The UI/UX comparison b/w amazon and flipkar was amazing and seeing the reazoning was cool too.</p>
        <p>I could not find the link to the redesigning of the page, either its missing during the writing of this review or I didn't find it</p>
