    <h1>Notes for Exercise 1 - Level 1</h1>

    <p>
      Since I am already familiar with basic HTML and CSS, I was able to build
      this simple webpage by myself. The page includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A header with the title "My First Webpage".</li>
      <li>A footer with contact information.</li>
      <li>A main content area with ordered and unordered lists.</li>
      <li>An image with alt text for accessibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
