# Modular Platform Application with Annotation System


## Problem Statement

Create a platform application that is extensible with components, making it modular. Implement an annotation system to help users add information they feel is important (text, image, etc).


## User
-----

### User Requirements

* **Visualize Data**: Display data in various formats, such as tables, graphs, and cards.
* **Support Annotations**: Allow users to comment, interact, and annotate visualizations.
* **Provide Extensibility**: Allow users to customize and extend the system with new components and features.


## Plan
-----

### Component Structure

* **Data**: The actual data to be visualized.
* **Metadata**: Information describing the data, including display type and options.
* **Component Type**: The type of component (e.g., table, graph, cards).

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Implement Login and Session Management System**: Develop a secure login and session management system.
2. **Implement Annotation System**: Design and implement an annotation system that allows users to add information to visualizations.
3. **Create Initial Components**: Develop initial components, such as tables, graphs, and cards.
4. **Implement Extensibility Features**: Allow developers/users to customize and extend the system with new components and features.

### Milestones

* **Basic Component Framework**: Complete the basic component framework.
* **Annotation System**: Implement the annotation system.
* **Initial Components**: Develop initial components.
* **Extensibility Features**: Implement extensibility features.


## Exit Criteria
--------------

* **Component Framework**: The component framework is functional and scalable.
* **Annotation System**: The annotation system is implemented and allows users to add information to visualizations.
* **Components**: Initial components are developed and functional.
* **Extensibility**: The system is extensible and allows users to customize and add new components.


## Project Deliverables
----------------------

* **Executable Application**: A fully functional application that meets the exit criteria.
* **Component Framework Documentation**: Documentation for the component framework, including APIs and usage guidelines.
* **Annotation System Documentation**: Documentation for the annotation system, including APIs and usage guidelines.
* **User Guide**: A user guide that provides instructions on how to use the application and its features.
