# Clinical Trials Application


## Users
---- 

* **Researchers/Scientists**: Primary users who want to search and explore clinical trials for specific diseases.
* **Interaction**: Users will interact with the application to:
	+ Search for clinical trials by disease name
	+ View trial details in a table format
	+ Select columns to display
	+ Click on hyperlinked study titles to view detailed study information


## Plan
---- 
1. Integrate with the clinical trials API
2. Design and implement the table view
3. Add column selection feature
4. Implement hyperlinks for study titles
5. Develop a user-friendly interface

### Step-by-Step Development

1. **Version 0**: Set up the development environment and integrate with the API
2. **Version 1**: Implement the table view with basic columns
3. **Version 2**: Add column selection feature
4. **Version 3**: Implement hyperlinks for study titles
5. **Version 4**: Refine the user interface
6. **Final Version**: Test and refine the application

### Milestones

1. Completion of API integration
2. Implementation of table view
3. Completion of column selection feature
4. Implementation of hyperlinks for study titles
5. Completion of user interface refinement


## Exit Criteria
