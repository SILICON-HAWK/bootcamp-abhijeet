Scorecard Application for Biomolecule Analysis
==============================================

## Problem Statement
- **Create a scorecard application that takes data about a biomolecule and presents it in a digestible way while flagging unoptimal molecule/properties. The application should also utilize MolStar for 3D visualization of the molecule**

## Users
--------

- Scientists/Researchers: The primary users of the application, who want to analyze and optimize protein structures.
- Interaction: Users will interact with the application to: 
    - Visualize protein structures
    - Identify areas for optimization with the help of the scores provided by the scorecard
Plan and the visual information shown by molStar

## Development Roadmap
-----
- Version 0: Basic Scorecard Application
    - Develop a basic scorecard application that displays a table with protein properties and scores.
- Version 1: Integrate MolStar for 3D Visualization
    - Integrate MolStar to visualize protein structures in 3D.
    - Develop a user interface to display the 3D visualization.
- Version 2: Color Protein Structures based on Property Values
    - Add functionality to color protein structures based on specific property values and properties.
    - Develop a color-coding system to represent different property values.
- Version 3: Implement Controls for Interacting with MolStar Visualization
    - Implement controls to interact with the MolStar visualization, such as zooming, rotating, and selecting specific parts of the molecule.
    - Develop a user interface to display the controls.


## Milestones
------ 
- Develop the basic scorecard application (Version 0)
- Integrate MolStar and visualize protein structures (Version 1)
- Implement coloring based on property values (Version 2)
- Add controls for interacting with the MolStar visualization (Version 3)
- Conduct user testing and refine the application (Final Version)

## Exit Criteria

--------------
- The application successfully displays the scorecard with protein properties and scores.
- The application correctly visualizes protein structures using MolStar.
- The application accurately colors protein structures based on property values.
- Users can interact with the MolStar visualization using controls.
- The application is refined and user-friendly.


## Project Deliverables
----------------------
- Executable Application: A fully functional application that meets the exit criteria.
- User Guide: A document that provides instructions on how to use the application.
- API Documentation: Documentation for interacting with the application's API.
